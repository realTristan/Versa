# Warnings
- This was one of my first projects when learning Python. There are many security vulnerabilities which I am working out in my new anti-cheat: Reborn.
- I do not recommend using anything from the repository in competitive tournaments. 
- This is one of the first versions of Versa. This codebase is outdated from the actual released versions.
- Also check out Reborn which is made in Rust for WAY more security.

Versa Anti Cheat is an advanced gaming anti cheat that makes your life easier by integrating discord Web Hooks into the program. 
   - The program tracks key and mouse clicks to detect macros and auto clickers. 
   - It takes screenshots and lists all running programs on the users computer and sends them to a discord channel of your choosing!
   
Versa Anti Cheat also comes with a discord bot to help create VAC Keys more efficiently!
